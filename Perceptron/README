HW3: Perceptron
----------------------
In order to run the code, please run the shell script in this directory titled "runHW3.sh".
The script will output the following:
    1. Standard Perceptron Algorithm Results:
        a. Learned Weight Vector
        b. The average prediction error on the test dataset.
    2. Voted Perceptron Algorithm Results:
        a. W: A dictionary of all unique weight vectors.
        b. C: A dictionary of the count for correctly predicted examples for each weight vector.
        c. The average prediction error on the test dataset.
    3. Averaged Perceptron Algorithm Results:
        a. Learned Weight Vector
        b. The average prediction error on the test dataset.

*Please note that the number of weight vectors is large ~570. Therefore when it outputs in the terminal, it may take a
lot of space.*
