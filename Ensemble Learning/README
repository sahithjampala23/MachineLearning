HW2 Part 1: Ensemble Learning
------------------------------
- In order to run any algorithm, please refer to the __main__ section of the code, (bottom of main.py file).

- Main Algorithms:
    1. adaboost: Depending on the "T" passed to the method, adaboost will produce T weak classifiers, and create a strong
                 classifier by giving a vote and a set of predictions for each classifier t. The algorithm is set to output
                 the training and testing error of the final predictions for each respectively.
    2. bagged_trees: Depending on the desired learner, bagged_trees will create a collection of T trees, through ID3 or
                     RandomForest, and produce final predictions by taking the average of each tree. Note that the runtimes
                     for these algorithms are slower since there is not early stopping or pruning of the trees.
