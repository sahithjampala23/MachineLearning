HW1: Decision Trees
---------------------

In order to get prediction errors for each dataset, please refer to the "__main__" section.

1. For the Car Problem:
Use "car_train_df" and "car_test_df"

2. For the Bank Problem:
    - Use "bank_train_df" and "bank_test_df" for when "unknown" is treated as a value.
    - Use "adjusted_bank_train_df" and "adjusted_bank_test_df" when "unknown" is treated as a MISSING value.

3. Substitute the desired datasets in the run_model() method in the main section, and the out put will contain two dictionaries:

4. The first dictionary will contain the training errors in the order of Information Gain, Majority Error, and Gini Index.
   The second dictionary will contain the testing errors for the same order.
